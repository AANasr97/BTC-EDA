# 🚀 Proposal: Exploratory Data Analysis of BTC Price Data 📈

## Introduction 📚

Welcome to the exciting world of cryptocurrency analysis! In this proposal, we embark on a journey to explore the hidden gems within BTC (Bitcoin) price data. Our mission is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that unveils patterns, trends, and anomalies to fuel informed decision-making, forecasting, and trading strategies.

## Objectives 🎯

📈 Gain a comprehensive understanding of BTC price movements over time.
📊 Identify key statistics, patterns, and trends in BTC price data.
📉 Detect and analyze potential outliers and anomalies.
💹 Explore the intriguing relationship between BTC price and trading volume.
📢 Provide actionable insights and captivating visualizations for stakeholders.

## Data Sources 📊

For this exciting journey, we'll harness the power of historical BTC price data from a reputable cryptocurrency data provider - [KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tencars/392-crypto-currency-pairs-at-minute-resolution). Our dataset boasts essential columns:

- `time`: Timestamps of price data.
- `open`: Opening price.
- `close`: Closing price.
- `high`: Highest price during a given time period.
- `low`: Lowest price during a given time period.
- `volume`: Trading volume.

This dataset contains the historical trading data (OHLC) 1 minute resolution reaching back until the year 2013. It was collected from the Bitfinex exchange as described in [this article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-get-historical-crypto-currency-data-954062d40d2d).

The data in the CSV file is the raw output of the Bitfinex API. This means, there are no timestamps for time periods in which the exchange was down. Also if there were time periods without any activity or trades there will be no timestamp as well.

## Methodology 🧪

Our adventure comprises the following stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Embark on a quest to acquire historical BTC price data, ensuring it spans a significant time frame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Equipped with data cleaning spells, we'll handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Unleash the power of statistical magic to reveal the mysteries of BTC price central tendencies and variability.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Unearth hidden trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation using potent time series tools.
5. **Visualization**: Craft enchanting visualizations, including line charts, candlestick charts, and bewitching histograms, to reveal patterns and anomalies.
6. **Volume Analysis**: Dive into the depths to explore the relationship between trading volume and price movements.
7. **Anomaly Detection**: Utilize wizardry like Z-score and IQR to unveil and decipher outliers and anomalies.
8. **Insights and Recommendations**: Cast a crystal ball to provide valuable insights and recommendations for the stakeholders' journey.

## Expected Outcomes ❓

Our journey promises to unveil:
